# vesting-bootcamp

This project is a result of learning and applying the vesting smart contract from the Solana Bootcamp 2024.
This project is efficient in vesting spl tokens to employees of a company by their employer. 
The employer is allowed to decide the amount and cliff-time of vesting.
Currently only the smart contracts are written, testing and frontend integration is yet to be done.

Thank you...
